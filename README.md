# ITNASA

ITNASA was a simple quiz app used as a training tool for SKILLS Canada - IT Network & Systems Administration competitors.

Using PyGame, this was my first taste of Python.
At around ~400 lines, it features questions from the IT Network & Systems Administration challenge, along with a score recorder and a few tutorial slides.

## Warning

This application was developed back when I was in 10th grade.
As such, it's no longer supported or relevant.

However, if you want to see an entire quiz application developed with nothing but a mess of selection and loops, then be my guest.
